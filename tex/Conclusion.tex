In this dissertation, we have presented and elaborated on the  Bayesian framework and its utility in tackling various problems in biology. Starting with an application of Bayesian model selection, we elaborate and show an analysis of association analysis. Thereafter, we critically examine the limitations of association mapping analysis particularly as they pertain to the approach to GWAS. We offer perspectives on moving forward and describe how Bayesian approaches can be used to integrate quantitative genetics and systems biology approaches. Finally, we take a side-step and discuss an important analysis in cancer pertaining to expression of transposable elements.
