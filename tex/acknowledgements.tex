I am greatly indebted to my advisors, Profs. Paul Marjoram and Sergey Nuzhdin, and my committee member, Prof. Gary Rosen, for their continued support, intellectual stimulation and encouragement. Their guidance and support has helped me to explore diverse topics and experience a great breadth of research during my studies. I, also, benefited greatly from their wisdom and their mentorship will continue to have a profound effect on me throughout my life. 

I would also like to thank all my collaborators who I had the great privilege of working with during my research. They come from diverse cultural and intellectual backgrounds and each interaction has greatly enriched me. 

I would like to thank the funding agencies that supported my work and would like to thank the graduate school for supporting me through the Provost fellowship.
